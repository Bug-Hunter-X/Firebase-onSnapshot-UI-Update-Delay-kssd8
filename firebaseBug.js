In a Firebase project, data retrieved using `onSnapshot` might not update the UI immediately, especially if the data changes rapidly or there are many listeners. This can lead to stale data being displayed or unexpected UI behavior.  The problem is not necessarily an error in the Firebase code, but rather a timing issue due to asynchronous operations and potential UI update bottlenecks.
