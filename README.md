# Firebase onSnapshot UI Update Delay

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Firebase's `onSnapshot` function: delayed or missed UI updates. The problem arises from the asynchronous nature of data retrieval and the potential for bottlenecks in updating the user interface.

The `firebaseBug.js` file contains code that showcases the issue.  The `firebaseSolution.js` file provides a solution to mitigate this problem.

This issue is typically not a bug within Firebase itself, but rather a result of how asynchronous operations interact with UI updates. The solution focuses on efficient UI updates and leveraging appropriate state management techniques.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Install Firebase dependencies: `npm install firebase`
3. Configure your Firebase project and replace placeholders in the code with your project details.
